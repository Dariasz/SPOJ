    // See PURQ before trying to understand this. RUPQ just reinterprets what PURQ is doing without
    // actually changing any of the code. We are bound by what PURQ is doing: when a single value is
    // updated, the queried value from that index onward is affected (increases by the value added).
    // That's because PURQ calculates cumulative sums. Here, we don't want cumulative sums, we want
    // to add (the same) value to a range of elements, and query for the total value that's been added
    // to a single element. Updating a single element doesn't affect the elements after it. But we must
    // find an operation that does, since we're bound by how PURQ works. PURQ is saying "give me an
    // index to update and all queries from that index onward will be increased by the same amount."
    // RUPQ says "okay, here's an index and a value. We interpret this as ALL elements from that index
    // TO THE END of the array get increased by this value, so what you're saying about how the query
    // results are affected makes sense, thanks! Luckily, this interpretation allows us to do range updates."
