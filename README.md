SPOJ
=================

Working on C# solutions to the 200 most-solved problems on SPOJ: https://www.spoj.com/users/davidgalehouse/

Each solution has unit testing, which relies on compiling them from their source programmatically using Roslyn.
This is necessary because I want all solutions to be submittable to SPOJ without modifications or namespace clutter, so their build actions have to be set to none to prevent compilation errors like [CS0101](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0101) and [CS0017](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0017).

To keep everything clean, I/O is separated from the actual solving of the problems.
Performance of .NET's console I/O and number parsing can be an issue.
I use them whenever possible, but custom I/O handling is sometimes necessary.

Reusable components are housed in the Spoj.Library project.
Due to performance concerns I usually don't bother programming with extensibility or safety in mind.
For example, I seal classes aggressively and expose collections through readonly interfaces without bothering to prevent casting back to their non-readonly implementations.

On the rare occasion that C# is unavailable or insufficient, I use C++.
Style-wise I try to make my C++ solutions look like my C# solutions, because I don't remember the more common conventions.

Problems are organized by difficulty using [the levels from Civ V](https://www.civfanatics.com/civ5/info/difficulties/).
