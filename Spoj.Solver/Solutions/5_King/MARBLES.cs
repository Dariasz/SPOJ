// From k differently colored, infinite sets of marbles, counts the number of
// ways to choose n marbles s.t. there's always at least one marble of each color chosen.

    // Knowing how to solve the problem without the requirement of a marble for each color
    // is useful (and it's a common problem). Effectively we need to distribute the marbles
    // across colorCount number of bins. Say there's 10 marbles and 4 bins, then one configuration is:
    // m m m | m m | m | m m m m. Configurations represented like that map 1-1 to the possible
    // configurations. To count those configurations, note a configuration is gotten by choosing the
    // placement of 3 bars across 10 + 3 positions => there are C(13, 3) = 286 ways to place 10 marbles in 4 bins.
    // The problem's additional requirement forces us to place colorCount marbles by hand to begin with,
    // one in each color bin. Then we place marbleCount - colorCount remaining marbles across colorCount bins =>
    // C(positions, bars)
    // = C((marbleCount - colorCount) + (colorCount - 1), (colorCount - 1))
    // = C(marbleCount - 1, colorCount - 1).
    // But see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination#Number_of_combinations_with_repetition (above is a little backwards).
