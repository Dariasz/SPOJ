    // Knowing the coefficients of the polynomial x³ + ax² + bx + c, we want to find the sum
    // of its squared roots, r₁² + r₂² + r₃². This didn't seem as easy as the comments/ranking
    // implied it would be. First, remind yourself about the factor theorem:
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_theorem
    // https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Polynomial_Factor_Theorem. So to begin:
    //   x³ + ax² + bx + c
    // = (x - r₁)(x - r₂)(x - r₃) (from the factor theorem)
    // = (x - r₁)(x² - xr₃ - xr₂ + r₂r₃)
    // = x³ - x²r₃ - x²r₂ + xr₂r₃ - x²r₁ + xr₃r₁ + xr₂r₁ - r₁r₂r₃
    // = x³ - (r₁ + r₂ + r₃)x² + (r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₂r₃)x - r₁r₂r₃
    // Setting x = 0 shows that c = -r₁r₂r₃. Eliminating c from both sides and dividing by
    // x and then setting x = 0 shows that b = r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₂r₃, and similarly we can show
    // that a = -(r₁ + r₂ + r₃). Now consider the following (I thought to try this because
    // I knew it would include the sum of squared roots):
    //   (r₁ + r₂ + r₃)²
    // = r₁² + r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₂r₁ + r₂² + r₂r₃ + r₃r₁ + r₃r₂ + r₃²
    // = (r₁² + r₂² + r₃²) + 2(r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₂r₃).
    // Therefore:
    //   r₁² + r₂² + r₃²
    // = (r₁ + r₂ + r₃)² - 2(r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₂r₃)
    // = (-a)² - 2b (from above)
    // = a² - 2b.
    // The solution is independent of the c coefficient, so the 'trick' to getting AC (if you
    // don't have access to scanf-like handling), is to just avoid parsing c. It seems like
    // a lot of people aren't realizing that--rather, they're just seeking of scanf-like handling.

    // So I read this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem and thought that
    // it applied to this problem. Specifically, I thought that because the leading coefficient
    // is 1, every root of the polynomial must be a fact;or of the constant term c. That's wrong,
    // it's not every root, it's only every *rational* root. Some of the roots might not be
    // rational, and that's fine, the final answer can still be an integer since we square
    // the roots. This solution enumerates all the factors of c and tests to see if they're
    // roots, and then builds up the distance (sum of squared roots).
    // NOTE: This doesn't bother handling the large numbers present in the actual input.
