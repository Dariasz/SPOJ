    // I think about it like, if the first player doesn't have any move to play that'll allow them
    // to win no matter what the second player plays, then the second player must have some move
    // to play no matter what the first player plays, so given the start state, we know either first or
    // second wins. It's less weird than HUBULLU/NGM, there are only 3 moves that can be made by either
    // player in a turn. So the recursive solution is obvious, the start player can win for a stack size
    // of n if the start player **can't** win for a stack size of n - 1, n - k, or n - l. That is, the
    // first player can win if for some move the second player can't win.
