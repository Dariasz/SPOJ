    // mind it's really similar to BYTESM2. Need to be a little careful to consider all moves,
    // not just downward and diagonal, since vertices can have negative values. And we start
    // at the top middle, so can't let impossible moves from the top left impact results.
    // For example, recursively the answer for the bottom middle vertex is its vertex
    // cost plus the minimum cost of getting to any one of the four vertices from which
    // we can travel to it. For convenience, just going to consume the input array.
