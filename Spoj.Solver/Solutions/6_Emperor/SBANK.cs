    // http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2180073&seqNum=2.
    // Comparison-based sorts are O(nlogn) operations, but the operations here are string comparisons,
    // and these strings have such large prefixes in common, it's going to be like O(nWlogn). But
    // radix sort is like O(2Wn), and n is large so that logn above will matter (W is word length).
