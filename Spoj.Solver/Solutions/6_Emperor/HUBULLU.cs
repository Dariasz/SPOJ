    // Player one can choose number 1 as their first move, which is a divisor of everything
    // so was going to be removed by player two's move regardless. That means on the third turn
    // the game state is as if only player two had played a move, and apparently it's a losing
    // position for player one. But player one could've put player two in that same position
    // by playing his move before he did, contradicting the assumption and showing player two can't win.
    // In retrospect would've been less time-consuming and eureka-ey had I known anything about game theory:
