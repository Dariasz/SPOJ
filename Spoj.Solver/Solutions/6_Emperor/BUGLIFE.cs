    // own search state but the biggest part was using a List instead of a HashSet to store neighbors
    // (not making use of the HashSet functionality for this problem, and even if removing it leads to
    // creating a multigraph (a pair of ants going on more than one date), doesn't matter). I observed
    // no time difference when swapping search start position from first to last vertex. TLE when using
    // BFS instead of DFS. But my same solution gets AC and TLE across different submits so you should
    // probably figure out how those faster people did it.
