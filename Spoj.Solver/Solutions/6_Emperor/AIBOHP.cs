    // If the string starts and ends in the same characters, the insertion count is whatever
    // the count is for the substring excluding those two characters. It wouldn't make sense
    // to add characters before the start or after the end since (ignoring the case where they're
    // the same character as the start/end--because then just interpret the insert as inside, not outside)
    // a complementary character would have to be added on the other side. Once the palindrome is found,
    // all of characters before/after the original start/end could be cutoff without any problem, so we
    // know to never try adding them.
    // If the start/end aren't the same... we'll necessarily have to add a character on the start or end
    // at some point--that's the only way to reconcile the difference. We can either add the start character
    // to the end or the end character to the start. Once that happens, the same reasoning shows we'd never
    // want to add any characters before the start or after the end, so the solution can be gotten by recursing
    // on what's inside, depending on where the insert happens. For example, take some string (the interior whatever):
    // a___b =>
    // Case where start inserted on the end: a___ba, so 1 + (solution for ___b) inserts needed.
    // Case where end inserted at the start: ba___b, so 1 + (solution for a___) inserts needed.
    // This recursive solution lends itself pretty naturally to dynamic programming, in a similar way as TRT.
    // That is, a 2D table with indices [i, j] corresponding to substrings solution, the answer in the top right.
