    // Okay so, I just experimented with pen & paper for an hour and convinced myself the following
    // was worth trying. It seems there are two options. You can start by using the small jug to
    // fill the large jug, or by using the large jug to fill the small jug. Once you start either
    // of these processes, it becomes clear there's always only one productive next move. For example,
    // take jugs w/ limits 5 & 16. Starting with small jug, you fill small jug, dump into large jug.
    // It wouldn't make sense to fill large jug at this point, you could've just done that in the first
    // place. So only viable move is to fill small jug and dump it into the large jug again, and so on,
    // until the large jug fills up and you're left with some remainder in the small jug. At that point
    // it wouldn't make sense to fill small jug, as we've already done that. Only sensible move is to
    // empty large jug and pour small jug into it, and then repeat the process. Similar stuff when
    // starting with the large jug. I tried a few and it seems like all multiples of the two limits' GCD
    // are generated (and nothing else), but haven't proven that. If that's true it's not really a fact
    // we need to use, as we could just recognize when the simulation starts to repeat (assuming that
    // that wouldn't take too long) and stop it then.
