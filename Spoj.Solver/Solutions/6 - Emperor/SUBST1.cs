        // in common with the ith + 1, so those substrings are repeated in the string. We wait to count
        // the ones in common until they become not in common for some j > i in a later iteration. For the
        // length that's not in common with the ith + 1, we count it now. Distinct substrings are only
        // counted once because they're not counted until the first time they're not in common with the
